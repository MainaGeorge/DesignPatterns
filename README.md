# DesignPatterns
This is a project with some basic implementations of design patterns in .net.  It is meant to be a guide to the reasoning and insight to the popular design patterns

Design patterns are typical solutions to common problems in software design. Each pattern is like a blueprint that you can customize to solve a particular design problem in your code.
They define a common language that helps your team communicate more efficiently.

All design patterns can be categorized by their intent, or purpose into three main groups of patterns:
   * **Creational patterns** provide object creation mechanisms that increase flexibility and reuse of existing code.
   * **Structural patterns** explain how to assemble objects and classes into larger structures, while keeping these structures flexible and efficient.
   * **Behavioral patterns** take care of effective communication and the assignment of responsibilities between objects.
   
**Structural Design Patterns**
  * Adapter Pattern
  * Bridge Pattern
  * Composite Pattern
  * Decorator Pattern
  * Facade Pattern
  * Flyweight Pattern
  * Proxy Pattern

**Behavioural Design Patterns**
*Chain of responsibility
*Command
*Iterator
*Mediator
*Memento
*Null Object
*Observer
*State
*Strategy
*Template method
*Visitor

**Creational Desing Patterns**
*Abstract Factory
*Builder
*Factory Method
*Object Pool

*Singleton
