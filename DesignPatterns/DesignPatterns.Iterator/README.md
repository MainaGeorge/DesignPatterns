An iterator pattern is a type of behavioral pattern that is used to sequentially access the elements of a collection without exposing its underlying or internal representation.

When to use Iterator Pattern
	*When we wish to provide a way to access and traverse the elements of a collection without revealing the internal data structures to the clients.
	*When we want the application to traverse different data structures.
