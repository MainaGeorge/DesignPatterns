# DesignPatterns.AbstractFactory

Provide a level of indirection that abstracts the creation of families of related or dependent objects without directly specifying their concrete classes. 
The "factory" object has the responsibility for providing creation services for the entire platform family. 
Clients never create platform objects directly, they ask the factory to do that for them.
