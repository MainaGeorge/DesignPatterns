# DesignPatterns.Decorator

In Decorator Pattern, we can add or remove object functionality without changing the function or external appearance of the object. 
Therefore with help of a decorator pattern, we can add additional responsibilities to an object without changing the functionalities of the object.

When to use Decorator Pattern
	*It enhances the extensibility of an object, as changes are made by coding new classes.
	*Provides greater flexibility as compared to static inheritance.
	*Rather than coding all behaviour into a single object Each specific part of the functionality is simplified by coding a series of classes.
