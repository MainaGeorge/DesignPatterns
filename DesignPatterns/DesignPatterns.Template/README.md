# DesignPatterns.Template

A template pattern is used to define the framework of an algorithm in the superclass and lets the subclasses redefine certain steps of an algorithm without changing the overall algorithm's structure.

When to use Template Pattern
	*When several classes contain almost identical algorithms and we need to modify all the classes when there is a change in the algorithm.
	*When we want to allow the clients to extend only particular steps of an algorithm, but not the whole algorithm or its structure.
