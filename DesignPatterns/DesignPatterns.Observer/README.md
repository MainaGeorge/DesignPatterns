# DesignPattern.Observer

An observer pattern is a behavioral pattern that is used to monitor the state of multiple objects or classes.
It acts as a notifier of change to multiple classes. 
Using the observer pattern, the change in the state of an object is reflected among other objects in the application.

When to use Observer Pattern
	*When modifications in the state of one object require a change in other objects.
	*When some objects must observe other objects only for a limited time or in specific cases.
