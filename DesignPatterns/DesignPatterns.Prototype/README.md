# DesignPatterns.Prototype

Prototype design pattern is one of the creational design patterns. 
It allows us to specify objects which are prototypes of original objects. 
In other words, it allows us to copy existing objects instead of making new instances.

Prototype Design Pattern is mainly used when creating new objects from scratch is expensive and we are already having similar classes for creating such objects.
With the help of Prototype Design Patterns, we copy new objects from already existing classes and modify these objects according to our new requirements.
