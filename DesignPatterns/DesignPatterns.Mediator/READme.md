# DesignPatterns.Mediator

The mediator pattern is used to simplify the communication between multiple objects or classes. 
It provides a mediator class that handles all the interactions going on between different objects or classes. 
This pattern also promotes loose coupling by keeping objects from referring to each other explicitly.

When to use Mediator Pattern
	*When the application consists of such a large number of objects that it becomes difficult to manage their references.
	*When it is difficult to change some classes because of the presence of tight coupling.
