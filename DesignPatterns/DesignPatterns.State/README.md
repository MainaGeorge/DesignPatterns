# DesignPatterns.State

A state pattern is a behavioral design pattern that is used when a specific object needs to change its behaviour based on its internal state. 
It provides a way for an object to partially change its type at runtime. 
It appears as if the object changed its class at runtime.

When to use State Pattern
	*When we have an object that behaves differently depending on its current state.
	*When we wish to implement different class behaviours according to the current values of the class’s fields.
