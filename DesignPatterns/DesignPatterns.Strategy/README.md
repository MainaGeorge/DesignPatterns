# DesignPattern.Strategy

A strategy pattern or Policy pattern is a behavioral design pattern that helps us to write a generic code that gives us specific behaviour needed for given use cases. 
It allows us to select both the behaviour and the algorithm at runtime, based on the input of the client.

When to use Strategy Pattern
	*When we have a use case of deciding how the objects will behave dynamically.
	*When we want to use different variants of an algorithm within an object and be able to switch from one algorithm to another during runtime.
