# DesignPatterns.Adapter

The adapter pattern helps in converting the interface of a class into another interface depending on the client's requirements.
So, basically providing what is required by the client by using the service of a class with a different interface. 
Adapter pattern is also famously known as **Wrapper**.

When to use Adapter Pattern:
	*When you want to create a reusable class that can cooperate easily with other classes, which does not have any compatible interface.
	*When you want to use an object in a certain environment that is expecting an interface that is different from its object interface.
	*When you want to use an existing class, but its interface does not match the interface the class needs.

**Basically, the adapter pattern acts as an intermediate state between two classes.**
