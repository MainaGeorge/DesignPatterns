# DesignPatterns.Visitor

The visitor design pattern is used to separate an algorithm from the object structure on which it operates. 
It allows us to define and add new operations to the existing classes without affecting the existing structure.

When to use Visitor Pattern
	*When we wish to perform an operation on all the elements of a complex object structure.
	*When we wish to extend the interface of the primary type by creating a separate class hierarchy.
