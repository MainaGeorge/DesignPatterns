# DesignPattersn.Facade

In Facade Pattern, we provide a simplified interface to a set of interfaces of a subsystem for hiding its complexity of subsystem from the client. 
In simple words with the help of facade pattern, we make sub-systems easier to use by describing a higher-level interface.

When to use Facade Pattern
	*When there are many dependencies between implementation classes of abstraction and client requirements.
	*When you want to have layers in your subsystems.
	*When you want to provide a simple interface instead of a complex subsystem.
